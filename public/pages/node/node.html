<h3>
    What is Node.js? Why is Node.js used?
</h3>
<p>
    Node is a runtime environment for javascript, it uses the V8 javascript engine made by google. Running the javascript engine out of the browser enables it to do other tasks than just frontend vanilla JS, javascript with node can be used for desktop applications. Because of Nodeâ€™s strength (handling a lot of I/O concurrently), Node is primarily used for servers. Another advantage of using Node for your backend is that you can simplify development by using the Javascript language for both the frontend and the backend.

<h3>Importing / Exporting with standard Node Module system</h3>
<p>
    To import modules with node we have been using the syntax:
    <br>
    <code class="language-js">const express = require("express")</code>
    <br>
    
    If you wanna import a module outside the node_modules folder you can give the path as an argument to the require function.
    
    Node also supports ES6 with another syntax for importing which we haven't been using.
