    <h1>Project-/Package Manager</h1>
    <h3>npm</h3>
    <p>npm is the default package manager for node and node comes bundled with npm. npm is used to manage the packages
        or dependencies. yarn is popular alternative to npm</p>
    <h3>package.json</h3>
    <p>
        The way npm works is with the package.json file, this file specifies what packages the project is using and its
        version. When you download a project all its dependencies aren't included instead you run the terminal command
        <kbd>npm i</kbd> to install the dependencies in the correct version for the project.
    </p>
    <h3>scripts</h3>
    <p>
        Scripts can also be defined in the package.json which will run with the <br> <kbd>npm run script-name</kbd>
        <br>
        Installing a package locally (only in this project) <br>
        <kbd>npm i package-name</kbd>
        <br>
        Installing a package globally (access in all projects) <br>
        <kbd>npm i -g package_name</kbd>
    </p>
