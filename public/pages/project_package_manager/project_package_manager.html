    <h1>Package Manager</h1>
<h3>npm</h3>
<p>npm is the default package manager for node and node comes bundled with npm. npm is used to manage the packages or dependencies. yarn is popular alternative to npm</p>
<h3>package.json</h3>
<p>
    The way npm works is with the package.json file, this file specifies what packages the project is using and its version. When you download a project all its dependencies aren't included instead you run the terminal command npm i to install the dependencies in the correct version for the project.
</p>
<h3>scripts</h3>
<p>
    Scripts can also be defined in the package.json which will run with the <code>npm run script-name</code>

        Installing a package locally (only in this project) 
        <code>npm i package-name</code>
        
        Installing a package globally (access in all projects) 
        <code>npm i -g package_name</code>
</p>
