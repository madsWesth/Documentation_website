    <h1>REST API and Express</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>REST</h3>
    <p>REpresentational State Transfer is architecture that is stateless, which means that it is unconcerned with the
        client, in other words it doesnâ€™t keep a session. It is meant to act the same regardless of the client and each
        request or response does not need information about previous communication.</p>
    <h3>REST API conventions</h3>
    <p>To make REST APIs easier to use for other developers it is nice to have a standardized way of structuring
        endpoints in the API. That way you can figure out how to use an API without studying the documentation. </p>
    <h3>JSON</h3>
    <p>JavaScriptObjectNotation is a file format that is popular to transfer data. JSON is very easy to read and write
        as a human unlike some other formats. Parsers are also available for most programming languages which makes it
        easy to work with. I've primarily used JSON with the REST APIs we have made.</p>
    <h3>Express</h3>
    <p><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> is a web framework according to their website. We have installed
        Express as a dependency and used it for both REST API and to serve a website.</p>
    <h3>Sending data</h3>
    <p>To send data with express the response object is used. The response object is a representation of the HTTP
        response.
        This is code from the backend of this project
    <pre><code class="language-js">        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
            res.send(constructedFrontpage)
        })</code></pre>
    This serves a website that is rendered on the server SSR.
    You can also send a file by using <code class="language-js">res.sendFile()</code> and you can set the status code with <code class="language-js">res.status(200).send({})</code>
    </p>
    <h3>Serving Static Assets in Express</h3>
    <p>To only allow some files to be shared we use:
    <pre><code class="language-js">       app.use(express.static("public"))</code></pre>
    This allows content in the public folder to be served. This folder is called public by convention in node.
    </p>
    <h3>Server Side Rendering in Express</h3>
    <p>
        his website is made with SSR which means that the html is constructed on the server and then sent to the client. You can also do client side rendering where you serve the entire (or most) of your web app. It is then rendered on the client this gives it a slow initial load but very responsive feel as you can just alter the dom whenever needed instead of requesting a new page from the server. SSR gives a quick initial load, but isn't as responsive.
I have divided my content into different components and page content, this is nice because I can reuse components. The different components and content is put together to construct a complete page that is then served.
<pre><code class="language-js">    //content
    const frontpage                     = fs.readFileSync("./public/pages/frontpage/frontpage.html").toString()
    const javascriptConceptsPage        = fs.readFileSync("./public/pages/javascript_concepts/javascript_concepts.html").toString()
    const nodePage                      = fs.readFileSync("./public/pages/node/node.html").toString()
    const projectPackageManagerPage     = fs.readFileSync("./public/pages/project_package_manager/project_package_manager.html").toString()
    const restPage                      = fs.readFileSync("./public/pages/rest/rest.html").toString()
    
    //constructed webpages
    const constructedFrontpage                   = header.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER", "Home").replace("%%HOME_ACTIVE", "active") + frontpage + footer
    const constructedJavascriptConceptsPage      = header.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER", "Javascript concepts").replace("%%JS_CONCEPTS_ACTIVE", "active") + javascriptConceptsPage + footer
    const constructedNodePage                    = header.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER", "Node").replace("%%NODE_ACTIVE", "active") + nodePage + footer
    const constructedProjectPackageManagerPage   = header.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER", "Project-/Package Manager").replace("%%PROJECT_ACTIVE", "active") + projectPackageManagerPage + footer
    const constructedRestPage                    = header.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER", "REST and Express").replace("%%REST_ACTIVE", "active") + restPage + footer
    

    The constructed page is then served 
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send(constructedFrontpage)
    })
</code></pre>
For some pages I needed to change something in the reused components. To do this I have placed placeholder text in the components that I could then later replace with replace()..
This is a simple template engine.
