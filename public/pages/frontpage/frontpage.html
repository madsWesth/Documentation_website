<h1>Welcome to my documentation page</h1>
<p>This is a webpage that has notes for the material ive been through so far in my NodeJS elective.</p>
<p>
    For this assignment i also wanted to learn a css framework.
    I have chosen to use Bootstrap because I've heard about it previously and it seems easy to use, i know there are some other ones like Tailwind or Bulma.
