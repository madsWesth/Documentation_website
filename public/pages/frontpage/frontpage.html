<h1>Welcome to my documentation page</h1>
<p>This is a webpage that has notes for the material ive been through so far in my NodeJS elective</p>
<p>
    For this assignment i wanted to also learn a css framework.
    I have chosen to use Bootstrap because I've heard about it previously and it seems easy to use, i know there are some other ones like Tailwind or Bulma.

<code>
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
        res.end('Hello World');
      });
</code>
