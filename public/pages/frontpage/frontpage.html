<h1>Welcome to my documentation page</h1>
<p>This is a webpage that has notes for the material I've been through so far in my NodeJS elective.</p>
<p>
    For this assignment I also wanted to learn a css framework.
    I have chosen to use Bootstrap because I've heard about it previously and it seems easy to use, I know there are some other ones like Tailwind or Bulma.Â´
    The website should also work well on mobile.

<pre><code class="language-js">    app.get("/", (req, res) => {

      })
</code></pre>
