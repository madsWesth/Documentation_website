<h1>Javascript Concepts</h1>
<br>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>
Javascript is a dynamically typed language so you don't have to identify your variables with a type, the type will be inferred.<br>

Variables can be declared with different keywords and what keyword you use controls some properties of the variable.<br>

<ul>
    <li>Variable with the let keyword is a variable you can reassign.</li>
    <li>Variable with the const keyword is a variable you cannot reassign.</li>
</ul>

let and const are new to Javascript and were introduced in ES6. The reason for the introduction of these new keywords was that the older var keyword was unintuitive and caused a lot of errors. 
The new keywords are block scoped which is more similar to how variables behave in other programming languages.<br>
</p>
<h3>Callback functions</h3>
<p>A callback function is a function that is passed to another function. These are often used in asynchronous programming as a function to be called after an asynchronous operation finishes</p>
<h3>Clean code / code conventions</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't use the var keyword unless for support on old browsers</li>
        <li>Use const instead of let wherever possible.</li>
        <li>Don’t scope variables outside functions if avoidable.</li>
        <li>Use functional programming style wherever possible usually with loop methods. This is a replacement to the imperative fori style</li>
        <li>
            Be consistent with the code style strings with double quotes or single quotes?
            End a statement with ;? indentation? This doesnt really matter for the program but it makes code more readable if its all consistent. Companies will have their own style guides that should be followed for this reason. This also extends to conventions that are used. Some plugins can help with this, like ESLint. 

        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Loops (loop/array methods) functional style coding</h3>
<p>These are methods introduced in ES5 which allows you to perform common tasks on arrays very concisely in a very easy to read manner.
    These methods use a declarative approach which means you don’t explicitly specify how something should be done or in what order.
    These are some of the methods that i've used so far.
    <pre><code class="language-js">    array.filter()
    array.forEach()
    array.find()
    array.findIndex()
    array.map()
    array.reduce()</code></pre>
